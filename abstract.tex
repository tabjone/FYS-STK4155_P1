In this report we looked at the differences between the ordinary least square-, lasso- and ridge-regression methods. We also used the resampling methods of bootstrap and cross-validation. This was all used on a dataset made using the Franke function with noise and terrain data from the Oslo area taken in the SRTM mission in 2000. We did not find big differences between the regression methods for the Franke function, but Lasso and Ridge did better on the terrain data.
