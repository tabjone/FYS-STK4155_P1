%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Parameters %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% n_data = 20 - n_data in x and y: n_tot = 20*20
% test_size = 0.2
% noise = 0.2 - aptitude of normal distributed noise    
% data_dim = 2

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Part b %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% * Evaluate MSE up to 5.th order fro OLS. 
% * and R2 score
% * blot parameters beta
% * Your code has to include a scaling/centering:
%   XXX: not included, data is already scaled in intervall [-1, 1]

%For bootstrap: should consider plotting a histogram of the estimators beta_hat^* as this should resemble a pdf.
