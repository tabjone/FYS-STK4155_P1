%scaling of data. Why we did or didn't scale. Critical discussion of this.

%Mention train/test split, 2/3 or 4/5 split is usual. Mention that this is usual and then what we used. Where exactly to mention this? May need to restructure method section a bit.

\subsection{Datasets}
Our data was generated from a random uniform distribution on the interval [0,
1] using the numpys random module. Two arrays was generated at random, with each containing n=20 data points. 
These arrays, x and y was combined in two mesh grids, X and Y each of size n x n. Thus, our
total dataset consisted of 400 data points. Before any fitting was done on the
data the mesh grids was reshaped into one dimensional arrays.  

\subsubsection{Franke Function}
%What is it
%How did we implement it
%Why did we implement it
%Any testing to know its working correctly? (I think not needed)

The Franke Function was used to test and validate our models.
The Franke function is a waited sum of four exponentials and takes two
arguments as input: 
\begin{align*}
    \label{eq:franke_function} 
    f(x,y) &= \frac{3}{4}exp\left(-\frac{(9x-2)^2}{4}-\frac{(9y-2)^2}{4} \right)
    + \frac{3}{4}exp\left(-\frac{(9x+1)^2}{49}-\frac{(9y+1)}{10} \right) \\
           &+ \frac{1}{2}exp\left(-\frac{(9x-7)^2}{4}-\frac{(9y-3)^2}{4}
           \right)-\frac{1}{5}exp(-(9x-4)^2-(9y-7)^2)
\end{align*}
This function is widely used for testing of different fitting algorithms. 
Before we applied our fitting algorithms on the terrain data, we used this function
to test and validate that our own developed algorithms worked properly.    

Random normal distributed noise with an amplitude of 0.2, zero mean and a
standard deviation of 1 was added to the data generated from the Franke
function. Our data was split in train and test data, with $20\%$ preserved for
testing purposes, which is a common train/test split. Sklearn's train\_test\_split function was used for splitting
of the data. In order to keep the dataset consistent between different runs, a
random seed generator was used. Our training data was fitted to polynomials up
to degree 12 in x and y. 



\subsubsection{Terrain data}
%How did we implement it
%Where did we find this
%Why do we use it

The data is from the Oslo area. The specific radar map we are looking at can be downloaded from \href{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/scene/metadata/full/5e83a3ee1af480c5/SRTM1N59E010V3/}{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/scene/metadata/full/5e83a3ee1af480c5/SRTM1N59E010V3/}. If the link is outdated, the information of the image location can be found in table \ref{tab:radar_data}. It's from the SRTM mission in February of 2000 with entity ID SRTM1N59E010V3. The data has a resolution of one arc-sec, which gives each pixel a resolution of 30m. This is given as a .tif file from the website and we use imageio's v2.imread to read the image. But as this dataset is too big, $1801\times3601$ pixels, for what computation power we have available there is two ways we could go forward. Either we start by rescaling the dataset and therefore lose information or we create a model on a smaller part of the data. We have chose the latter and will look at a slice in the top left corner of 20x20 datapoints.

\end{table}



\subsection{Error estimation}
%Maybe something about implementation of this
To assess the accuracy of our models we will use the mean squared error
$$
MSE(\boldsymbol{y},\tilde{\boldsymbol{y}}) = \frac{1}{n}
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(y_i-\tilde{y}_i)^2,
$$
where n is the number of datapoints. This measures the difference between the model value and the actual value and will be taken from sklearn.metrics. 

And we will use the score function
$$
R^2(\boldsymbol{y}, \tilde{\boldsymbol{y}}) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \tilde{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1} (y_i - \bar{y})^2},
$$
which is used to score the model. The functions

\subsection{Linear regression}
%Something about how we implemented this. Maybe a bit more text here also
For the design matrix we used what is called a Vandermonde design matrix, a matrix for polynomial linear regression
\begin{center}
$\boldsymbol{X}=
\begin{bmatrix} 
1 & x_{0}&x_{0}^{2}&\dots &x_{0}^{p-1}
\\1&x_{1}&x_{1}^{2}&\dots &x_{1}^{p-1}
\\1&x_{2}&x_{2}^{2}&\dots &x_{2}^{p-1}
\\ \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\
1&x_{n-1}&ax_{n-1}^{2}&\dots &x_{n-1}^{p-1}
\end{bmatrix}
$
\end{center}

random seed generator was used. 

\subsubsection{Desing matrix}

Our training data was fitted to polynomials up
to degree 12 in x and y. Thus, a design matrix of the form:
\begin{equation*}
    X = 
    \begin{bmatrix}

        1 & x_{0} & y_0 & x_{0}^{2} & x_0 y_0 & y^2 & \dots &y_{0}^{p} \\
        1 & x_{1} & y_1 & x_{1}^{2} & x_1 y_1 & y^2 & \dots &y_{1}^{p} \\
        1 & x_{2} & y_2 & x_{2}^{2} & x_2 y_2 & y^2 & \dots &y_{2}^{p} \\
        \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        1&x_{n-1} & y_{n-1} & x_{n-1}^2 & x_{n-1} y_{n-1} & y_{n-1}^2 & \dots &y_{n-1}^{p}, 
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
was used for OLS-, Ridge- and Lasso regression
The following code snippet was used to generate our Design matrix: 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
for i in range(1,p+1):
    q = int((i)*(i+1)/2)
    for k in range(i+1):
        X[:,q+k] = (x**(i-k))*(y**k)
return X
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
FUNCTION create_X(x, y, n)
	X = array(size p, size n)
	FOR i = 1 TO i = p
		q = int((i)*(i+1)/2)
		FOR k = 0 TO k = i
			X[:,q+k] = (x**(i-k))*(y**k)
		ENDFOR
	ENDFOR
	return X
ENDFUNCTION
\end{lstlisting}

, where p is the polynomial degree and X is the Deign matrix. 
In order to reduce the number of computations, we generated one Design matrix
with number of features corresponding to the maximum polynomial degree $p_{max}
= 12$. This matrix has l features including the intercept given by the
equation: 
\begin{equation*}
        l(p) = int(((p+1)*(p+2)/2))		
\end{equation*}
In order to fit the lower order polynomials this matrix was sliced in the
following way:
\begin{equation*}
    X_{\text{train}}[:,l(p)] 
\end{equation*}

  
% XXX: added y terms to matrix
% XXX: Changed from poly p-1 to p
% %We used the Vandermonde design matrix for a linear regression polynomial fit. No point in having a theory section about this.
% \begin{center}
% $V=
% \begin{bmatrix} 
% 1 & x_{0}&x_{0}^{2}&\dots &x_{0}^{p-1}
% \\1&x_{1}&x_{1}^{2}&\dots &x_{1}^{p-1}
% \\1&x_{2}&x_{2}^{2}&\dots &x_{2}^{p-1}
% \\ \vdots &\vdots &\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\
% 1&x_{n-1}&ax_{n-1}^{2}&\dots &x_{n-1}^{p-1}
% \end{matrix}
% $
% \end{center}




\subsection{Regression methods}
Three different regression methods was applied to the Franke data and terrain
data.  
\subsubsection{OLS}
%%OLS
%How did we implement it
%Why did we implement it
%Did we do any testing
The optimal values for beta with OLS regression $\hat{\bm{\beta}  }_{OLS}$ was
calculated from equation
\eqref{eq:beta_OLS}. The solution only exist when $(\bm{X}^T \bm{X})$ is
invertible. To circumvent this problem we used numpy's pseudo inverse, to invert
the matrix.

Our own OLS method was compared with Sklearn's method
(sklearn.linear\_model.LinearRegression). For the same training data, without
any re-sampling. Both methods agrees up to polynomial fits of degree nine.  

\subsubsection{Ridge}
%%Ridge
%How did we implement it
%Why did we implement it
%Did we do any testing
In the case of Ridge regression we introduced an array of regularization
parameters $\lambda = [10^{-6}, 10^{-5}, \hdots, 10^{1}]$. The optimal values
of beta with ridge regression $\hat{\bm{\beta } } _{Ridge} $ was calculated
from equation \eqref{eq:beta_ridge}. 

\subsubsection{Lasso}
%%Lasso
%How did we implement it
%Why did we implement it
%Did we do any testing
The same regularization parameters as used for Ridge regression was used to find the
optimal values for beta with Lasso regression, $\hat{\bm{\beta } } _{Lasso} $. We did not develop our
own algorithm for Lasso regression. Insted we used the function provided by the
sklearn python module.  

\subsection{Resampling}

%%Cross-validation

How to set up the cross-validation for Ridge and/or Lasso

* Define a range of interest for the penalty parameter.

* Divide the data set into training and test set comprising samples $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus i$ and $\{ i \}$, respectively.

* Fit the linear regression model by means of ridge estimation  for each $\lambda$ in the grid using the training set, and the corresponding estimate of the error variance $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)$, as

\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda) & =  ( \boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T}
\boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast} + \lambda \boldsymbol{I}_{pp})^{-1}
\boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T} \boldsymbol{y}_{-i}
\end{align*}

* Evaluate the prediction performance of these models on the test set by $[y_i, \boldsymbol{X}_{i, \ast}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]$. Or, by the prediction error $|y_i - \boldsymbol{X}_{i, \ast} \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda)|$, the relative error, the error squared or the R2 score function.

* Repeat the first three steps  such that each sample plays the role of the test set once.

* Average the prediction performances of the test sets at each grid point of the penalty bias/parameter. It is an estimate of the prediction performance of the model corresponding to this value of the penalty parameter on novel data. It is defined as

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\{L[y_i, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}.
\end{align*}
