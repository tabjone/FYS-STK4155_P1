How to set up the cross-validation for Ridge and/or Lasso

* Define a range of interest for the penalty parameter.

* Divide the data set into training and test set comprising samples $\{1, \ldots, n\} \setminus i$ and $\{ i \}$, respectively.

* Fit the linear regression model by means of ridge estimation  for each $\lambda$ in the grid using the training set, and the corresponding estimate of the error variance $\boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)$, as

\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda) & =  ( \boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T}
\boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast} + \lambda \boldsymbol{I}_{pp})^{-1}
\boldsymbol{X}_{-i, \ast}^{T} \boldsymbol{y}_{-i}
\end{align*}

* Evaluate the prediction performance of these models on the test set by $[y_i, \boldsymbol{X}_{i, \ast}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]$. Or, by the prediction error $|y_i - \boldsymbol{X}_{i, \ast} \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda)|$, the relative error, the error squared or the R2 score function.

* Repeat the first three steps  such that each sample plays the role of the test set once.

* Average the prediction performances of the test sets at each grid point of the penalty bias/parameter. It is an estimate of the prediction performance of the model corresponding to this value of the penalty parameter on novel data. It is defined as

\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n \log\{L[y_i, \mathbf{X}_{i, \ast}; \boldsymbol{\beta}_{-i}(\lambda), \boldsymbol{\sigma}_{-i}^2(\lambda)]\}.
\end{align*}
