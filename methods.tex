\section{Method}

%Maybe something about how we implement bias-variance tradeoff
%Maybe section about using SVD for inverting matrix, or maybe section on SVD in theory




%%Describe the methods and algorithms. 
%Section about Franke-Function, why we use it and how we use it
%Section about terrain data, why and how

%psudocode on implemntation and algorithms

%%Error estimation, code testing ect
%Section about error estimation, R^2 and MSE
%if some benchmarking thing put here, so that reader can verify results. Extremely important that parameters are included in report.
