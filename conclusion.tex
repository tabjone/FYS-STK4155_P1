\section{Conclusion}



We found that using the Lasso and Ridge methods over the OLS on Franke data did not have much benefits on the MSE. But for the terrain data we got a much better with fit with the regularization parameter. This could be because the Franke function is a smooth and easy function to fit and the terrain data can have a much more complex shape. We also found that for the Franke function bootstrapping and k-fold resampling decreased the total error of the model up to certain polynomial degrees where the variance got exponentially higher because of overfitting. This is because when working with a smaller dataset, overfitting will happen sooner.
